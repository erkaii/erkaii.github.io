I’m Erkai Yu, an undergraduate major in Computer Engineering. I like operating system development and system security things, feel free to contact me if you’re interested in those as well. I [play chess](https://www.chess.com/member/alphatwenty) as a hobby, send me a challenge and I will definitely accept it. Also, I’m a big fan of learning natural languages, please teach me to speak in your mother tongue!
